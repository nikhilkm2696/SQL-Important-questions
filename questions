Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

Assumption:

There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
candidates Table:
Column Name	Type
candidate_id	integer
skill	varchar
candidates Example Input:
candidate_id	skill
123	Python
123	Tableau
123	PostgreSQL
234	R
234	PowerBI
234	SQL Server
345	Python
345	Tableau
Example Output:
candidate_id
123
Explanation
Candidate 123 is displayed because they have Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL skills. 345 isn't included in the output because they're missing one of the required skills: PostgreSQL.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Solution
Candidates with a variety of skillsets have applied for this role, but we need candidates who know Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

We'll start by using the IN operator to find candidates which have some of the required skills:

SELECT candidate_id
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL');
The output should look something like this: (Showing random 5 records)

candidate_id	skill
123	Python
123	Tableau
123	PostgreSQL
345	Python
345	Tableau
We can see from the output that these candidates possess at least one of the necessary skills, but keep in mind, the problem is asking for candidates who have ALL THREE of these skills, so we aren't done quite yet!

It's important to keep in mind that the candidates table does not contain any duplicates, so each combination of candidate and skill is a unique row. Therefore, a candidate should have exactly 3 rows for each of the necessary skills in order to be qualified for the job.

Now, we group the candidates table by candidate ID using the GROUP BY clause and count the number of skills for each group using the COUNT function.

Let's look at the total number of required skills for each candidate:

SELECT
  candidate_id,
  COUNT(skill) AS skill_count
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id;
Output:

candidate_id	skill_count
123	3
345	2
Candidate 123 possesses all three of the required skills in this instance, but Candidate 345 possesses only two of the required skills.

In the last step, we'll use HAVING to select only candidates with three skills and ORDER BY the candidate ID, as per the task.

Note that the full solution below counts skills inside the HAVING, not in the SELECT as shown above.

Full Solution:

SELECT candidate_id
FROM candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
HAVING COUNT(skill) = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id;

other solution:
select candidate_id from (select candidate_id,Count(candidate_id) from 
(select candidate_id from candidates where skill in ('Python','Tableau','PostgreSQL')) as a

group by candidate_id) as c where count=3 order by candidate_id




2)
Assume you are given the tables below about Facebook pages and page likes. Write a query to return the page IDs of all the Facebook pages that don't have any likes. The output should be in ascending order.

pages Table:
Column Name	Type
page_id	integer
page_name	varchar
pages Example Input:
page_id	page_name
20001	SQL Solutions
20045	Brain Exercises
20701	Tips for Data Analysts
page_likes Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
page_id	integer
liked_date	datetime
page_likes Example Input:
user_id	page_id	liked_date
111	20001	04/08/2022 00:00:00
121	20045	03/12/2022 00:00:00
156	20001	07/25/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
page_id
20701
Explanation: The page with ID 20701 has no likes.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

SOLUTION:There are two ways to go about it. Either LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN can be established between tables pages and page_likes or a subquery can be used to identify which pages have not been liked by any user.

The LEFT JOIN clause starts selecting data from the left table. For each row in the left table (pages), it compares the value in the page_id column with the value of each row in the page_id column in the right table (page_likes).

When page_id are found on both sides, the LEFT JOIN clause creates a new row that contains columns that appear in the SELECT clause and adds this row to the result set.

In case page_id frompages table is not available in page_likes table, the LEFT JOIN clause also creates a new row that contains columns that appear in the SELECT clause. In addition, it fills the columns that come from the page_likes (right table) with NULL. Rows having NULL values in the result is the set of the solution.

Read about LEFT JOIN [1] and RIGHT JOIN [2] to get the better understanding.

Solution #1: Using LEFT OUTER JOIN

SELECT pages.page_id
FROM pages
LEFT OUTER JOIN page_likes AS likes
  ON pages.page_id = likes.page_id
WHERE likes.page_id IS NULL;
Another solution to this problem, since pages with NO LIKES are needed, would be the NOT EXISTS clause (refer to Solution #2). It's an appropriate and efficient operator to get this information. Check out here.

Both methods give the same output.

Solution #2: Using NOT EXISTS

SELECT page_id
FROM pages
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM page_likes AS likes
  WHERE likes.page_id = pages.page_id);
Solution #3: Using EXCEPT

SELECT page_id
FROM pages
EXCEPT
SELECT page_id
FROM page_likes
ORDER BY page_id;


my-solution:::::::::


SELECT page_id from pages
where page_id not in (select distinct(page_id) from page_likes)
order by page_id ASC




3)Tesla is investigating bottlenecks in their production, and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query that determines which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions

Table parts_assembly contains all parts in production.
A part with no finish_date is an unfinished part.
parts_assembly Table
Column Name	Type
part	string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer
parts_assembly Example Input
part	finish_date	assembly_step
battery	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
battery	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
battery	03/22/2022 00:00:00	3
bumper	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
bumper	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
bumper		3
bumper		4
Example Output
part
bumper
Explanation
The only item in the output is "bumper" because step 3 didn't have a finish date.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!



Solution
The parts table already contains all of the parts that are currently in production, meaning that we do not have to do any additional filtering for the parts that are not in production.

All we need to do is extract the parts that are not yet finished. We can accomplish this by filtering for rows with no data present in the finish_date column. We call these missing values NULL.

Some parts might be represented multiple times in the query data because they have several assembly steps that are not yet complete. To solve this, we can group part or apply DISTINCT function to obtain the unique parts.

SELECT part
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL
GROUP BY part;
OR

SELECT DISTINCT part
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL;


mysolution:SELECT DISTINCT(part) FROM parts_assembly where finish_date is NULL;
